            <h3>Surah Al-Fatiha (1:1-7)</h3>
            <p>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
                The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment. You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help. Guide us on the Straight Path, the path of those who have received Your grace; not the path of those who have brought down wrath upon themselves, nor of those who have gone astray.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Surah Al-Baqarah (2:255)</h3>
            <p>Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Surah Al-Ankabut (29:69)</h3>
            <p>And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.</p>
